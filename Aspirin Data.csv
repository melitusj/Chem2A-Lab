I have drawn out an equation with structural formulas for the reaction.,10
Part 25,
Answer,Count of students
The number of moles of acetic anhydride was greater than the number of moles that would react completely with the amount of salicylic acid in the reaction mixture. Excess acetic anhydride was therefore left over in the reaction mixture after all the salicylic acid had been converted to product. The acetic anhydride remaining at the end of the reaction was decomposed by adding water to the reaction mixture prior to crystallization.,2
"The number of moles in acetic anhydride is greater, so the number of moles that would react with the amount of salicylic acid in the reaction mixture.",1
"Excess acetic anhydride was used to make sure the reaction was done to completion, if we had not had an excess, the experiment wouldn't be possible. It becomes decomposed when you add water, as to why we use it to form the crystals.",1
We had more acetic anhydride than necessary to completely react with the available salicylic acid,1
Acetic anhydride was added to the reaction in order to complete it. It was decomposed by water at the end of the reaction.,1
This means that there was more acetic anhydride in the reaction causing there to be an excess amount be left over in the reaction,1
It was used to neutralize the salicylic acid.It was evaporated.,1
acetic anhydride was used in excess to ensure all of the salicylic acid reacts to form acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). Any excess acetic anhydride that did not react was hydrolyzed to form acetic acid,1
it means everything in there broke down leaving nothing remaining for the experiment,1
